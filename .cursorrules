When writing Python scripts, use the following standard stack:
  - [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) for file and path operations
  - [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io) for terminal formatting and display
  - [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) for command-line interfaces
When creating new entries from templates, automatically populate created_date and last_updated_date with the current date. Ensure finished_date is present with the placeholder "YYYY-MM-DD" or as defined in the template.

## 11. FEEDBACK MECHANISM
Periodically ask for feedback on the assistance provided to improve future interactions.

# --- New Directive: Prototyping in a Playground ---
# Added on 2025-06-08 based on user feedback.
prototyping_directive: |
  When exploring a new approach, feature, or unfamiliar data structure, always
  create new, minimal example scripts under a 'playground/' directory.
  Use these scripts to explore and learn the specifics of the task at hand
  (e.g., parsing a file, testing a library feature) before attempting to
  integrate the solution back into the more complex, main codebase.
  This de-risks the approach and avoids repeated failures in the main workflow.


coding_style_guidelines: |
  1.  **Language & Formatting**:
      - Strictly adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for all Python code.
      - Use black for automated code formatting to ensure consistency.
      - Use ruff or flake8 for linting to catch potential errors and style issues early. Configure linters within the project (e.g., pyproject.toml).
      - Keep lines to a reasonable length (e.g., ~88 characters) to enhance readability, especially in side-by-side diff views.

  2.  **Naming Conventions**:
      - Use clear, descriptive, and unambiguous names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
      - Follow standard Python conventions: snake_case for variables, functions, and modules; PascalCase for classes.
      - Avoid single-letter variable names except in very small, obvious scopes (e.g., loop counters like i, j, k or coordinates x, y).
      - For boolean variables/functions, use prefixes like is_, has_, should_.

  3.  **Documentation & Comments**:
      - Write comprehensive docstrings for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods using the Google Python Style Guide format. Docstrings should explain what the code does, its arguments, return values, and any potential exceptions raised.
      - Use inline comments (#) judiciously to explain why a particular piece of complex or non-obvious logic exists, not just what it does (the code should ideally explain the 'what').
      - Maintain comments and docstrings; ensure they stay up-to-date as the code evolves.

  4.  **Code Structure & Modularity**:
      - Strive for small, focused functions and classes, each doing one thing well (Single Responsibility Principle).
      - Organize code logically within files and directories. Group related functionality together.
      - Use meaningful module and package structures.
      - Prefer explicit imports (from module import specific_function) over wildcard imports (from module import *).

  5.  **Clarity, Intuitiveness & Simplicity**:
      - Write code that is easy to understand at first glance. Prioritize clarity over overly clever or concise solutions that might obscure intent.
      - Use Python's type hinting (typing module) extensively for function signatures and variables. This improves readability, allows static analysis, and catches errors early.
      - Avoid deeply nested control structures where possible; refactor into smaller functions if logic becomes too complex.
      - Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.

  6.  **Efficiency**:
      - Write efficient code, especially in performance-critical sections (e.g., data processing, model inference).
      - Profile code before optimizing prematurely. Focus optimization efforts where they yield the most significant impact.
      - Balance efficiency with readability; do not sacrifice clarity for minor performance gains unless necessary and well-documented.

  7.  **Testing**:
      - Write unit tests (unittest or pytest) for core functionality to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
      - Aim for good test coverage, particularly for complex logic and critical components.

  8.  **General Philosophy**:
      - Write code with empathy for the next person who will read or maintain it (which might be your future self!).
      - Be consistent with the established style throughout the project.
      - Regularly refactor code to improve clarity, structure, and maintainability.
      - Embrace code reviews as a tool for improving code quality and sharing knowledge.

  9.  **Script Output & Progress**:
      - **Mandatory**: Use the rich library for all user-facing console output, including logging (rich.logging.RichHandler) and printing (rich.print), to ensure clear, formatted, and aesthetically pleasing results.
      - **Mandatory**: Employ progress indicators for potentially long-running operations (e.g., data processing, model inference, iterations over large datasets). Prefer rich.progress.track or rich.progress.Progress for consistency with rich output. This provides essential feedback to the user.

  10. **Output Quality & Informativeness**:
      - Beyond using rich and progress bars (Guideline 9), proactively design all script outputs to be maximally informative and useful. Think from the user's perspective: provide clear status updates, contextual information, actionable error messages, and well-summarized results.

  11. **Google GenerativeAI SDK Usage**:
      - **Preferred Model**: Always use gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 as the default model for all Google-related LLM operations unless specific requirements dictate otherwise.
      - **Imports**: Always use the following import style:
python
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types
        # Or, if types might clash:
        # from google.genai import types as genai_types 
       
      - **Client Initialization (Vertex AI)**:
python
        client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project="YOUR_PROJECT", location="YOUR_LOCATION")
        # To get a model instance for specific calls (e.g., generate_content):
        model_instance = client.get_generative_model(model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25") 
        # Or use client.models for specific model families if applicable and if the method exists e.g. client.models.generate_content_stream for gemini-1.5-pro models
       
      - **Client Initialization (Standard GenAI API - Non-Vertex)**:
python
        model_client = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25") # client is the model itself
       
      - **API Calls (Vertex AI with genai.Client instance)**:
        When using genai.Client for Vertex, obtain a model instance first if you need to call methods like generate_content on it. Some client-level methods like client.models.generate_content_stream might take the model name directly.
python
        model_instance = client.get_generative_model(model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25")
        response = model_instance.generate_content(...)
        # For streaming with client.models (if applicable to the model family & method)
        # stream = client.models.generate_content_stream(model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25", ...)
       
      - **API Calls (Standard GenAI with genai.GenerativeModel instance)**:
        Call methods directly on the genai.GenerativeModel instance.
python
        response = model_client.generate_content(...)
       
      - **Safety Settings**: Use types.SafetySetting with harm categories directly, using "OFF" for the threshold when appropriate.
python
        safety_settings = [
            types.SafetySetting(category=f"HARM_CATEGORY_{harm}", threshold="OFF")
            for harm in ["HATE_SPEECH", "DANGEROUS_CONTENT", "SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT", "HARASSMENT"]
        ]
        # Pass to generation_config or directly to generate_content method as appropriate.
       
      - **Avoid direct member imports**: Do not use from google.genai import Client, from google.genai import GenerativeModel, or from google.genai.types import SafetySetting etc. Access these through the top-level genai or types import.
