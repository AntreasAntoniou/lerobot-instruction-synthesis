## Key Concepts

### The Problem
Traditional robotic data collection is:
- ⏰ **Time-consuming**: Hours of repetitive demonstrations
- 🔄 **Limited**: Scripted tasks miss edge cases
- 💰 **Expensive**: Manual annotation is costly

### Our Solution
Freestyle data collection offers:
- ⚡ **95% time reduction**: 5 minutes → hours of data
- 🎯 **10x more diversity**: Natural exploration
- 🤖 **Automated annotation**: AI-powered understanding

### How It Works
1. **Record**: 5-minute freestyle robot manipulation
2. **Segment**: AI identifies distinct actions
3. **Annotate**: Multimodal models describe tasks
4. **Generate**: Structured datasets ready for training
